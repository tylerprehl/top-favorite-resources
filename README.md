# The Odin Project - Favorite Resources
The reason for this repo is to be able to easily reference some of my favorite (the most enlightening) resources from The Odin Project (which if you have never heard of, you should definitely check out! - https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I've done my done my best to sort them by CS language, framework, concept, etc, but please forgive any misplacement. This is just for my own personal reference to be able to talk to some of the concepts/CS history I found most interesting during interviews, and also to share cool concepts with friends. :)
